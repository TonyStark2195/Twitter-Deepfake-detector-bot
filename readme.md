# Twitter Deepfake detector Bot

- Developed twitter bot combining AI and crowdsourcing to detect deepfake videos and stop social disinformation
- Created Storyboard and Mock UI to visualize the interface interaction using **Figma** tool
- Trained AI model (**Efficient-Net**) using Facebook’s Deepfake Detection Challenge Dataset for video classification

\
Python Packages used: **Pytorch, tweepy (twitter API), requests, urllib, beautifulsoup, os, time, regex, moviepy, logging**
\
Other technologies involved: Git, Toloka.ai crowdsourcing platform,

The weights can be placed in the empty folder weights provided with the zip.

If not the sourcecode github link can be used to follow but it is very time consuming!
